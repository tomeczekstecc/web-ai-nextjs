# Specification Quality Checklist: JSON-Driven Navigation Menu Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Clarification session (2026-05-12) resolved 5 questions. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Phase breakdown (4 phases) is included in the spec as an Implementation Phases section for reference; the plan phase will convert this into detailed design artifacts.
- The `top-menu` layout mode is intentionally scoped as a typed stub only (Phase 4) — full rendering is deferred to a future feature.
- Clarifications applied: refetch policy (sign-in/sign-out events), prefix-match active route highlighting, auto-expand parent on load, TeamSwitcher/NavProjects removal, Zustand store not cleared on sign-out.
